    "While Jerome Powell at the Federal Reserve offers himself up as a messenger to shoot, across town, the executive branch is sending increasingly erratic and tariffed messages. The administration’s economic policies are like a loud, crowded kitchen cooking up new ways to bewilder the country’s—and by proxy, the world’s—money. Trump is full of bluster, but it can’t all be hot air.\n",
    "\n",
    "Critics believe he is either purposefully tanking the economy to enrich his allies or flying blind—high on impulsivity and power. Supporters, on the other hand, see a calculated strategy: crash the economy by nearly a quarter of its value, forcing an exodus into treasuries. This, they argue, would push the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates, allowing the country’s debt to be refinanced. The result? A deflationary spiral that lowers the cost of everything while increasing the stability of treasury bonds. By this logic, Trump’s tariffs and their effect on market volatility are not a bug—they’re a feature.  \n",

    "Everyone has an angle—from the president to the mom-and-pop investor. There are puts and calls, pumps and dumps; massive buys and even bigger shorts. Cryptocurrency, meanwhile, has added a new layer of abstraction. Traditional speculation is still tied to the performance of a living, breathing company. Crypto, however, is based on little more than processing power (traditionally). The rise of retail traders in crypto and equities alike has flooded the market with new money, increasing both participation and volatility."
