    "Consumer sentiment dropped to **57.9** in March, the lowest since November 2022. There’s uncertainty in the markets—and even more regarding the direction the economy is headed. While the Fed just announced its intention to keep interest rates steady, that offers little relief to the average consumer. Tariffs, though not yet finalized, loom large on the horizon. Everything seems to be coming to a head within the economic organism, but how that head will manifest remains to be seen. Stocks are dropping, energy is rising—but what does this all mean?\n",

    "In 1988, scientist Roger Nelson began the Global Consciousness Project (GCP). As part of the already controversial Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research lab (PEAR), the GCP sought to prove the existence of collective consciousness. Using a network of random event generators—called “electrogaiagrams” (a term coined by the project team)—that flipped 200 virtual coins per second, the project measured how global events might affect patterns in randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parapsychology is a shaky enterprise at best, but the GCP reported some eerie anomalies. For instance, they claimed a noticeable spike in non-random activity before 9/11. They also registered serious anomalies exactly 24 hours before the 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake and Tsunami. Other world events showed similar patterns. The folks at GCP argue these cumulative Z-scores deviations—versus the chance expectation one would expect from truly random data—portend a truly significant result. But what that result is isn't clear.\n",
