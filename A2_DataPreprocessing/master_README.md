## 🧭 Folder Descriptions

### `/main/`
The stable production-quality version of your dataset engineering and feature pipeline.
- Contains cleaned CSVs, labeled event frames, and tested model scaffolding
- Best for generating reliable exports and sharing insights

### `/sandbox_week3/`
A high-velocity experimentation zone — test new features, alternate label logic, or novel modeling techniques here.
- Includes advanced visual diagnostics (dashboards, ROC curves, PCA clusters)
- Trained models and metrics are neatly split for performance comparison

## 🛠️ How to Work Across Folders

1. **Prototype inside `sandbox_week3/`**  
   Try new visualizations, lag structures, or modeling setups

2. **Document results clearly** in its internal README  
   Use plots + metrics to make your case

3. **Promote tested improvements** to `main/`  
   Only once they are reproducible and properly logged

---

## 🔗 Recommended Readmes

- `/main/README.md` — Stable documentation of data logic and structure
- `/sandbox_week3/README.md` — In-progress notes, visual guides, experimental logs

---

## 👥 Collaboration Notes

- Keep `main/` clean and version-controlled
- Use `sandbox_week3/` like a lab notebook — track what you tried and what worked
- Archive older sandboxes (e.g., `sandbox_week2/`) as needed
